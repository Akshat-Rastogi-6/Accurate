# Accurate: Simplifying Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to Accurate! This Python-based machine learning project aims to streamline the process of solving machine learning problems without requiring any coding knowledge. With Accurate, all you need to do is provide your dataset and fill out a simple form tailored to your needs. That's it – solving machine learning tasks has never been easier!


## Features

- **Code-Free Solution**: Accurate eliminates the need for writing complex code to solve machine learning problems.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simply provide your dataset and fill out a form according to your requirements.
- **Customization**: Tailor the machine learning process to your specific needs through easy-to-use form fields.
- **Efficiency**: Accurate automates the process, saving you time and effort while delivering accurate results.

## Getting Started



## Installation

Visit accurate.streamlit.app for the direct usage of the application.
###

## Usage/Examples

To illustrate how Accurate works, let's consider a scenario where you have a dataset containing information about housing prices. With Accurate:

1. You provide the housing dataset.

2. You fill out a form specifying your objectives, such as predicting class, training-testing splitting, which ml model you want to apply, evaluation matrix.

3. Accurate processes the data, trains a machine learning model, and provides you with accurate predictions for housing prices.
